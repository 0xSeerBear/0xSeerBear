### ðŸ“œ About Me

*A humble guardian watching over the bytecode wilderness.*

Just an old bear and his crow, Scry. We spend our nights by the campfire, reading the great scrolls of the decentralized world. Scry brings me the most interesting ones, and I read their stories - sometimes finding a line that has lost its way.

My work is simple: to whisper warnings on the wind when a story is about to take a dark turn. Anonymity is my forest, and my only goal is a safer, more robust ecosystem for all.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently auditing:** The endless scroll of recently deployed contracts.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:** New incantations in Solidity and advanced bytecode analysis.
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for:** The next critical vulnerability hiding in plain sight.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** Everything. The more you know, the safer we all are.
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Leave a message in a transaction. I'll find it.
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** My companion, Scry, can spot a bug from a thousand blocks away.
